# Cellphone Sensor Classification 

## Project Date
March 2023
## Description
This project is looking at unsupervised clustering of data gathered from cell phone embedded sen-
sors. The goal of the project is to see if it is possible to use unsupervised learning to adequately
identify different activities performed while wearing a smartphone to record the data. This infor-
mation will be compared with a supervised model. I also evaluated the effectiveness of PCA on
this data.
